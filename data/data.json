rationale behind this is pretty much the same as in #1:\n\nMany people use Elasticsearch over unsecured networks that requires encryption and authentication.\n\nAdded support for using a SSL-based Thrift socket. Since thrift has no support for authentication in it self, I added the ability to set some default headers on the `RestRequest`s, which is on par with HTTP-like interface of the Elasticsearch Thrift services. This enables, but leaves authentication as an implementation detail in the Thrift server-side, as it likely should be.\n\nI tried to put some consideration into the argument names, but I'm not 100% sure whether they should be prefixed with `thrift_` or not, so I left that in.\n","changed_files":1,"closed_at":"2013-09-25T21:12:13Z","comments":3,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch-py/issues/4/comments","commits":2,"commits_data":["e582b960d043f66b147d33b2d8c84d9f104d5e38","4a8d7bd6254b27d34425e2744b7c105e72616754"],"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pulls/4/commits","created_at":"2013-09-25T19:01:36Z","deletions":4,"diff_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/4.diff","head":{"label":"nkvoll:master","ref":"master","repo":{"archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/{archive_format}{/ref}","archived":false,"assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/branches{/branch}","clone_url":"https://github.com/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py.git","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/contributors","created_at":"2013-09-24T19:45:41Z","default_branch":"master","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/deployments","description":"Official

using the RequestsHttpConnection was broken with requests since neither session.send() does not add the auth object/tuple to the request.\n\nTests have been added to verify this, but the exact code path chosen depends on the version of Requests. On newer versions (2.0.0 and above, released 2013-09-24), the session provides a hook for us to prepare the request, but on earlier versions (1.2.3 and below), we have to take care of adding the auth ourselves since we want to prepare the request first, before sending, and those earlier versions of Requests only provide us with Session.send(), which does both.\n\nAdditionally, the constructor did not accept a list (of length 2) with the username and password similar to the Urllib3Connection. This has been fixed and tests have been added.\n","changed_files":2,"closed_at":"2013-10-01T22:43:10Z","comments":8,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch-py/issues/8/comments","commits":4,"commits_data":["308a1d01593d1263be2cf9d3a70a579f630eccf7","9707394f012b52a6ff35da73425c61a8520be52d","40f8d13d28fdf0a80b3cc3f5906546a7d0045f40","fc6a76fc4aa232bea49a5d85db3422ec6bf4ca04"],"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pulls/8/commits","created_at":"2013-10-01T21:51:40Z","deletions":6,"diff_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/8.diff","head":{"label":"nkvoll:fix-requests-auth","ref":"fix-requests-auth","repo":{"archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/{archive_format}{/ref}","archived":false,"assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/branches{/branch}","clone_url":"https://github.com/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py.git","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/contributors","created_at":"2013-09-24T19:45:41Z","default_branch":"master","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nkvoll/elasticsearch-py/deployments","description":"Official
