## Microtask 6

Perform any other analysis you may find interesting, based on the Perceval data you collected.

The metrics which are yet to be implemented can be found in [focus_areas](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/focus_areas/) folder. The implementation-pending metrics are to be implemented and to be pushed to implem[entations](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/implementations/) folder. The implemented metrics should be documented well in the [metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/metrics) folder.


The metrics are currently in three categories, [code_development](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/focus_areas/code_development.md), [community_growth](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/focus_areas/community_growth.md) and [issue_resolution](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/focus_areas/issue_resolution.md).
